I am not good at design, so I wanted to spend some time working on design for my solo project.  I had some help from Vika to help overcome some of my Deuteranopia.

So who has been doing nothing but navigating through as many webpages as they can find, trying to get to the right spot in the documentation for the last 48 hours?

GOOD NEWS!

It's going to get a little bit simpler. 

INTRODUCING: DOX!

It's all the docs in one simple place.  

Just type in the NPM package you want to know about.

(ASK the audience for suggestions)

Then BAM! You have all the documentation at your fingertips.

FEATURES:
    - DB caching of all searches and pages
    - Scraped versions of the github doc, NPM docs, and outstanding bugs

TECH:
    - React (with hand-rolled webpack, so Kyle doesn't shiv me while I sleep)
    - React Hooks
    - React Router
    - MongoDB (better for single one-to-many relationships, postgresQL would have required literally 50x as many database calls)
    - Express routing
    - Deployed (to Heroku)

STRUGGLES: 
    - I wanted to focus on the front end design, as I have a weak point there.  I spent a lopt of time with Vika working on picking out some colors.
    - I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to deep-link someone from outside with react router.  Still not sure how to do it, but that would be my next feature.
